# PowerMenu: A Little Script with a Big Context Menu Fix

## What's this all about?

Let's be honest, the new Windows 11 right-click menu--along with a number of other things--is horrible. PowerMenu is here to throw that sad excuse for a right-click menu out the window and bring back the clean, functional right-click menu we all know and love from Windows 10.

## WARNING: Be Careful! 

Messing with the registry (where Windows stores settings) can be risky if you don't know what you're doing. Think of it like playing with power tools â€“ awesome, but you gotta respect them.

**Always do this before running PowerMenu:**

1. **Backup your registry!**  There's a way to do this in the Registry Editor (`File` -> `Export`)

## How to use PowerMenu

1. **Download the repository:** `Green button` -> `Download ZIP`
2. **Extract the ZIP file:** Right click the file -> `Extract Here`
3. **Open the folder and run as Administrator:** Right-click the extracted `PowerMenu.bat` file and choose `Run as administrator`.
4. **Follow the instructions:** The script will tell you what to do!
5. **Restart Explorer (or your whole computer):** Changes might not show up until you do this!
